Documentation of Breast Cancer Prediction Code
1. Importing Libraries and Loading Data:

The first block of code imports necessary libraries and loads the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.
It then converts the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
The target values are mapped from numerical (0 for benign and 1 for malignant) to categorical labels ('B' for benign and 'M' for malignant).
2. Data Preparation:

The data is read from a CSV file named 'data 2.csv'.
We check for missing values and remove unnecessary columns.
The target column, 'diagnosis', is encoded to numerical values (0 for benign and 1 for malignant).
The data is split into features (X) and target labels (y), and then further divided into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
3. Feature Selection:

We use SelectKBest to select the top 10 most important features based on their scores.
This reduces the number of features used for modeling to improve performance and reduce complexity.
4. Model Tuning with Grid Search:

We use GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
Parameters such as the number of hidden layers, activation functions, solvers, and learning rates are tested to find the optimal combination.
The best parameters and their performance are printed.
5. Implementing and Evaluating the ANN Model:

With the best parameters from Grid Search, an ANN model is trained.
The model is evaluated on the test set to determine its accuracy and performance.
Predictions are made, and performance metrics like accuracy and a classification report are printed to assess the model's effectiveness.
6. Building and Evaluating a TensorFlow ANN Model:

An alternative ANN model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, consisting of two hidden layers with ReLU activation and an output layer with sigmoid activation.
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
The model is evaluated on the test data, and loss and accuracy metrics are printed.
Predictions are made, and a classification report and confusion matrix are printed to further evaluate the model.
Summary
Data Handling: Import data, clean, and prepare it for analysis.
Feature Selection: Select the most important features for modeling.
Model Tuning: Use grid search to find the best model parameters.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train and evaluate models using various metrics to ensure they perform well.
